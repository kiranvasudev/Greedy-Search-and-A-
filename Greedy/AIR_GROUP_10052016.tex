\section{Search Strategies}
\subsection{Uniform Cost Search}
The uniform cost search is an \textbf{optimal} algorithm with any step-cost function. It stores and orders its nodes in a queue related to their path-costs. The node with the lowest path cost will be expanded. The algorithm then tests the node, which is selected, if it is the goal. Not to apply the goal test before the node with the lowest path-cost is selected avoids to choose a suboptimal solution. It makes sure that all nodes are generated and considered first. The uniform cost search also provides a test for the case that a better path to the goal is found. The  search focuses on the total costs of the nodes, which leads to the \textbf{possibility of infinite loops} if zero cost paths are given.\\
\\
The complexity of this algorithm does not depend on the depth of the search. Instead it is characterized by the path costs. In the worst case of the complexity is \textbf{$O(b^{1 + \frac{C*}{\epsilon}})$ (worst case)}. The C* represents the costs of an optimal solution and $\varepsilon$ the costs which are guaranteed at every node (can be also higher than that). In the case (that all costs are equal the complexity is \textbf{$O(b^{d + 1})$ (best case)}. The algorithm is then quite similar to breadth-first search just with the exception that the uniform cost search does not stop after finding the goal, but after checking all nodes (in case a lower cost solution exists). In this case the algorithm expands nodes unnecessarily since all costs are the same and the optimal path was alread found.

\subsection{Limited Depth-First Search}
The limited depth-first search is an extension of the depht-first search. It adds a depth limit to \textbf{avoid failure in infinite state spaces}. In the limit depth the children nodes are not longer generated, because it is the end of the search. \\
\\
The limited depth-first search contains a few scenarios, which can lead to different results and characteristics: Setting up a limit can result in not finding the goal at all. This case occurs if the goal node is beyond the limit. If the limit is selected higher than the actually depth, the search is also nonoptimal. In cases of having more information of the states, the limit can be chosen more efficient. Such a limit is called diameter.\\
\\
In general is the time complexity of the algorithm  $O(b^{l})$ and the space complexity $O(b \cdot l)$ (l = limit). In case that the limit is infite, there is no difference to the depth-first search any longer.

\subsection{Informed Search}
The expression informed search is the generic term for search algorithms which use problem-specific knowledge to find solutions more efficient. This types of searches are also called heurisitic searches. Informed searches use their knowledge to build an evaluation function. The function evaluates if it is worth to expand the node to find the goal.
